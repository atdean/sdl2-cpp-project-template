This is just a simple, barebones repository you can clone for a ready-to-go C++ SDL2 project. It uses CMake to create build files and automatically finds and links to SDL2 and SDL2_image. I'll eventually expand this to include the other SDL libraries and maybe some other thingsâ€¦ right now I'm just learning C++ and SDL for fun and wanted something I can quickly start from. Pull requests are welcome if you see any errors or improvements.

To create the build files, cd into `build/` and run `cmake ..` and then `make`. Then, run the resulting `sdl2-cpp-project-template` executable from the same folder. It will just display a window with a blank white background until you close the window or hit Cmd+Q (or the equivalent on your platform).

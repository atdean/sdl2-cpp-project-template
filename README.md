This is just a simple, barebones repository you can clone for a ready-to-go C++ SDL2 project. It uses CMake to create build files and automatically finds and links to SDL2 and SDL2_image. I'll eventually expand this to include the other SDL libraries and maybe some other thingsâ€¦ right now I'm just learning C++ and SDL for fun and wanted something I can quickly start from. Pull requests are welcome if you see any errors or improvements.
